## profile options
- company name and logo


## form creation
- as a user visiting the form creation module, you will see a list of all forms that have been created on the left in a list 
- you will be able to select existing forms and edit these forms (kind of like templates)
- if you make an edit to a form then you will be warned that it will change every course form that is using this form template
- you will also be able to create new forms and delete forms
- forms will be divided into two main sections (general info/questions and payment options)
- when creating a new form you will enter all form fields for general info and payment options
- when creating a new form you will have lots of pre generated fields already existing that can be easily deleted or modified (like name, age, email etc.)
- when a form is selected you can also create a course form generated from that specific form
- when generating a course form you must enter the course form metadata (course name, location, date) 
- when a form is selected you can also duplicate the form and modify the duplicated version and change the name 

## existing forms/courses
- as a user first visiting the forms/courses i will see a list of course forms on the left
- when I click on a course form the link will be readily available
- when I click on a course form I should be able to edit the course form metadata (course name, course date, location)
- when viewing a course form you can change the form template the course form is using 
- when I click on a course form it will open a table of everyone that has filled a form and paid for that course (registrants)
- the table of registrants will initially only show the name and basic contact info of the registrant
- the name can be clicked to access the remainder of the form information for any given registrant
- in addition the table will show some basic information like the total registrantss that have signed up for the course and how much money has been generated
